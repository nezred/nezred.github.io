I'm a student of computer science, currently living in Sweden for
ERASMUS+ exchange at MDU, VÃ¤sterÃ¥s. I usually live in Ciudad Real,
at the ESI, UCLM. I'm interested in computer science, specially
in compiler theory, graphics, and AI. And I play games, watch shows and
all that, and collect everything interesting I find on the way.
