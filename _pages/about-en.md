Hi ðŸ¥°! I'm a student of computer science, currently living in Sweden for
ERASMUS+ exchange at [MDU](mdu.se), VÃ¤sterÃ¥s. I usually live in Ciudad Real,
at the [ESI, UCLM](esi.uclm.es). I'm interested in computer science, specially
in compiler theory, graphics, and AI. In my free time I play games, watch shows
and read, in general trying to find stuff that may have flown under most 
people's radar.
